Random Ints
- module is random

For Integrals, generate a dense square of points surrounding the range over which you are integrating, 
    find ratio of points under the curve vs total

Volume integrals:
    -generate densely populated rectagular prism around volume, check for points being inside boundaries of surface

Random Sampling
    -

Importance Sampling
    -p(x) = probability density (probability distribution function)
        -normalized over -inf to inf
        -p(x)dx is prob. of finding value in range(x, x+dx)
    -P(x) = cumulative prob. = int_-inf^x (p(x`)dx`)
        -dP(x) = p(x)dx
        -P(x) = randInt  =>
        -Use x = P^-1 (randInt) to generate points according to a prob. density.
