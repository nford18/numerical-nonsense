Numerical Methods in E&M

Electric field plot: Take some number of points in a circle surrounding all point charges 
                     and iterate lines out from those points
Equipotential: take some values of r away from weighted center of point charges
                and iterate lines out from those points

Poisson's equation: del^2(V) = rho/epsilon_0
Laplace's Eqaution: del^2(V) = 0
